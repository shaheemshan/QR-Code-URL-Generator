# QR-Code-URL-Generator
This Node.js project allows users to generate QR code images from URLs. Each entered URL is saved in a text file (url.txt) either separated by commas or on new lines, based on user preference. The project uses the inquirer module for interactive command-line input and the qr-image module for generating QR code images.
